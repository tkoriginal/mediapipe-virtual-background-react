# Selfie Segmentation with MediaPipe and React
With the increase in remote work and everyone taking calls at home. Most popular video conferencing apps have now implemented virtual background replacement since it improves the overall exprience and provide privacy enhancment in their homes or whevever they may be. 

In this post we will work on implementing virtual background for an app that you might be working on. We will be using WebRTC APIs to capture a stream from a camera and MediaPipe to use Machine Learning and WebAssembly to remove our background.

### MediaPipe


MediaPipe is a cross-platform ML solution for live and streaming media that was developed and open sourced by Google. Background replacement is just one of many feature including real time hand, iris and body pose tracking.
